The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the `initializeApp` method is called multiple times with different configuration objects. This can happen if you inadvertently initialize Firebase more than once in your application, perhaps in different modules or due to improper state management.  The error message might not be immediately obvious, and the underlying cause can be difficult to track down. This is particularly common in larger applications with multiple feature modules.

Example (Illustrative):

```javascript
// moduleA.js
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { firebaseConfigA } from './configA';
initializeApp(firebaseConfigA);

// moduleB.js
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { firebaseConfigB } from './configB';
initializeApp(firebaseConfigB); // This will cause an error if firebaseConfigA !== firebaseConfigB
```
